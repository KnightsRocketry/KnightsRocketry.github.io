                <p>We're excited to announce the official launch of the <strong>Knights Rocketry website</strong>! This new platform highlights who we are, what the American Rocketry Challenge is all about, and how sponsors can support our journey.</p>
                
                <p>Our homepage introduces the Knights Rocketry team, a group of students from Frisco, Texas with deep roots in STEM through years of robotics competitions. While new to rocketry, we're experienced in engineering and problem-solving thanks to our strong foundation in FRC.</p>
                
                <p>We’ve built this site to share our mission, our goals, and the challenge ahead. You’ll soon find information on how we’re designing and launching rockets to meet this year’s ARC requirements, which include carrying raw eggs to altitude and recovering them safely. As our season progresses, we’ll share updates, test results, and behind-the-scenes insights from our design and build process.</p>
                
                <p>The site is also the best place to explore sponsorship opportunities. We’ve outlined our Bronze, Gold, and Platinum tiers and what supporters receive in return, from social media shoutouts to prominent logo placement on our rocket.</p>
                
                <p>This website will serve as our central hub for updates. Be sure to check the blog often as we post behind-the-scenes progress, launch recaps, and big moments throughout the season!</p>
