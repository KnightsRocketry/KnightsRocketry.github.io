                   <p> We are thrilled to report that today's maiden launch of our rocket, the <strong>Nebula One</strong>, was a complete success. We achieved <strong>three for three successful launches</strong> at the Dallas Area Rocketry Society (DARS) field in Gunter!</p>

                   <p>After a last-minute fix to the fins right before launch, the Nebula One performed flawlessly. Flying on <strong>C6-5 motors</strong>, it had three beautiful, stable flights, reaching an estimated altitude of around <strong>450 feet</strong> each time. The recovery parachute deployed perfectly after every launch, which allowed us to recover the rocket in great condition.</p>

                    <p>Here is a video of one of the launches:</p>

                   <p>The experience at the DARS launch was incredible. We saw many high-powered rockets take to the skies, which was both humbling and incredibly motivating. Today was a huge success and a fantastic first step, and we know we have a long, exciting way to go.</p>
